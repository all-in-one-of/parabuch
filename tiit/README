TIIT is a tiny tool for image file inspection based on Houdini's 
HDK image library. It meant to work similary to Houdini's and OpenImageIO's 
'iinfo' utilities adding some functionalities. 

tiit does:
	- check file integrity (if it can be loaded into memory).
	- prints details about deep rasters, bit depths, channels etc.
	- prints statistic: min, max, avarage, std-dev, nans, infs etc.
	- prints hash number generated from one of an image planes.
	- print meta data.
tiit could:
	- fix found nans and infs (box interpolating neighbours).
	- print wavelet signature for content aware file comparision.
	- print rank of similarity based on two wavelet signatures.
	- find missing backets (hard but I believe possible).  
	- edit meta data in OpenEXR/JPEG files.


Currently code is horrible as it was written during one day
as a proof of concept.

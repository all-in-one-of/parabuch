TIIT is a tiny tool for image file inspection.

It was inspired by Houdini's and OpenImageIO's  'iinfo' utility. 
(First one doesn't do much besides printing rasters info, 
second one crashes being confused by per plane bit depth
variance in a file.)

tiit does:
	- check file integrity (if it can be loaded into memory).
	- prints details about deep rasters, bit depths, channels etc.
	- prints statistic: min, max, avarage, std-dev, nans, infs etc.
	- prints hash number generated from one of an image planes.
	- print meta data.
tiit could:
	- fix found nans and infs (box interpolating neighbours).
	- print wavelet signature for content aware file comparision.
	- print rank of similarity based on two wavelet signatures.
	- find missing backets (hard but I believe possible).  
	- edit meta data in OpenEXR/JPEG files.


Currently code is horrible as it was written during one day
as a proof of concept.

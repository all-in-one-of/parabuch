PointCache is a Houini SOP operator for applying point 
deformations stored in popular PC2 format described here:
http://www.footools.com/plugins/docs/PointCache2_README.html

It supports point groups, and it's about x40 faster from Python OTLs.
It also interpolates points' positions lineary or cubicly and 
recomputes normals after deformation applied.

To install, as usual, source Houdini's environment:

> cd houdini/path
> source hooudini_setup_bash

and then:

> cd pointcache
> hcustom src/SOP_PointCache.C

It should place SOP_PointCache.so to $HOME/houdiniX.X/dso 
ready to be used.

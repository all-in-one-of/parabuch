This is a HDK based converter to Houdini's bgeo volumetric format 
from a research solid tileable textures to be found here:

Authors of the paper kindy provide a number of synthetized textures on their 
website.
Once you have a bgeo from them, it can be used directly to shade your object 
or converted yet again to *.i3d 3d texture and used very efficently.

Here is a Maya plugin integrating solid textures directly into Maya:

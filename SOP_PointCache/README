PointCache is a Houini SOP operator for applying point deformation stored in popular PC2 format described here: http://www.footools.com/plugins/docs/PointCache2_README.html

It supports groups, and it's about x40 faster from Python implementations. It currently doesn't support interpolation though, so if you need one (and sampleRate < 1 in a file), append TimeBlendSOP and TimeWrapSOP for retiming: output_range = input_range*sampleRange,  

To install, as usual, source Houdini's environment:

> cd houdini/path
> source hooudini_setup_bash

and then:

> cd pointcache
> hcustom src/SOP_PointCache.C

It should place SOP_PointCache.so to $HOME/houdiniX.X/dso ready to be used.
